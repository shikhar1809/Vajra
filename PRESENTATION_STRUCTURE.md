## 📑 6-Slide Presentation Structure

### **Slide 1: Title Slide**
- **Main Title:** Vajra
- **Subtitle:** Enterprise Cybersecurity Protection Platform
- **Tagline:** "Defending Your Digital Assets with Divine Strength"
- **Visual:** Vajra Logo + Cyber-themed background (Hex/Grid pattern)
- **Footer:** Presenter Name / Date

### **Slide 2: The Problem (Why Vajra?)**
- **Heading:** The Cybersecurity Crisis for SMEs
- **Bullet Points:**
    - ⚠️ **Rising Threats:** SMEs face 350% more social engineering attacks than larger enterprises.
    - 🔍 **Vendor Risks:** 60% of data breaches originate from third-party vendors (Supply Chain Attacks).
    - 🚦 **Traffic Volatility:** DDoS and bot traffic can cripple business operations instantly.
    - 💸 **Cost Complexity:** fragmented security tools are expensive and hard to manage.
- **Visual:** A graphic showing a "fractured shield" or multiple arrows attacking a central server.

### **Slide 3: The Solution (Introducing Vajra)**
- **Heading:** Vajra: Unified Defense Architecture
- **Core Concept:** An all-in-one platform that unifies Traffic, Vendor, Employee, and Code security.
- **Value Proposition:**
    - **Centralized Control:** Single Dashboard for all security ops.
    - **AI-Powered:** Intelligent anomaly detection and automated responses.
    - **Proactive:** Prevents attacks before they happen, not just reporting them.
- **Visual:** A central "Core" (Vajra) connected to 4 orbiting nodes (Shield, Sentry, Scout, Agenios).

### **Slide 4: Key Modules (The 4 Pillars)**
- **Heading:** 360-Degree Protection Modules
- **Content (Split into quadrants):**
    1.  🛡️ **Shield (Traffic):** Real-time monitoring & **"Bunker Mode"** for lockdown during active attacks.
    2.  👁️ **Sentry (Employees):** Phishing detection, file malware scanning, and geofencing for remote teams.
    3.  🔍 **Scout (Vendors):** Third-party risk scoring, compliance tracking, and breach attribution.
    4.  💻 **Agenios (Code):** Automated penetration testing and static code analysis for vulnerabilities.
- **Visual:** Icons for each module with brief keywords.

### **Slide 5: Key Innovation - "Bunker Mode"**
- **Heading:** Unique Defensive Capability: Bunker Mode
- **Context:** What happens when an attack is detected?
- **Workflow:**
    1.  **Trigger:** Anomaly detected (High traffic/Suspicious pattern).
    2.  **Lockdown:** System activates "Bunker Mode" instantly.
    3.  **Challenge:** Non-verified users face multi-step challenges (OTP, Pattern Draw, CAPTCHA).
    4.  **Result:** Bots are blocked; Legitimate users pass through; System remains operational.
- **Visual:** A flow chart showing Traffic -> Anomaly -> Bunker Mode -> Safe/Blocked.

### **Slide 6: Tech Stack a Compliance**
- **Heading:** Built for Performance & Trust
- **Technology:**
    - **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 18, Tailwind CSS (Modern & Fast).
