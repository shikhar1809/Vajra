I am building a app named Vajra
it is a cybersecurity app for Small Medium enterprices and Buisness

I have thought the app to have 4 module
Vajra Shield - A shielf that is always their tracking the app or website
                      of the buisness usage noting avg user flow at specific
                      time and triggers when a usual amount of users.
                      gain access to the wesbite in a small time.
                      Then it starts what is called a bunker mode
                       Each user has to pass some hand curated tests
                       like  OTP verification or write on the screen using pen tool 
                       to gain access to the site and more [YOU THINK MORE
                       VALUABLE ADDITION TO THIS]

Vajra Scout - This feature helps buisness owners to check the vendors
                      cyber-security compliance and track record and if a data
                      breach occurs the responsible vendor is tracked.
                      Design specific algorithms and use open source tools
                      to determine the cyber security prowess of these 
                      distributed vendors.  [YOU THINK MORE

Vajra Sentry - This feature is designed to help the buisnesses employees
                       stay away for the cyuber -security threats it have 
                       tools for phishing that uses Google SafeWeb for info
                       and also document scanner that scans the document
                       for potential malware through open source libraries
                      and also has own algorithm and also tracks the employees
                      live geo-location such that the employee can only use the
                      app or access the admin priviliges when it is in designated
                      workpace and connected to designated safe router for 
                       web access.  [YOU THINK MORE

Vajra Agenios -this feature is used to analyse the user application 
                        codebase , run various new type of malware attacks
                         and breaching and penetration attacks and see 
                         if the code will actually hold off a cyber security attack or 
                         not.
